## Getting Started

First, you need to create .env file and add next variables:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://rdddwlvrkqpprdmhftju.supabase.co

NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6InJk
ZGR3bHZya3FwcHJkbWhmdGp1Iiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE2OTMzOTk2ODcsImV4cCI6MjAwODk3NTY4N30.
8W_877i5kwcQp2POVJNrSl82zPJ3Q3DBnHnfYyDhhEc
```

(I didn`t add env because it's not cool to do that)


Now, you can run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Now, have fun on my Mini Blogging Application!

You can use one of this user to log in into app:

```bash
#1
user@gmail.com 
password: 12345678
role: Comentator

#2
user2@gamil.com
password: 12345678
role: Author
```

You also can create your own account! Really!
Just click on button bellow `Need to create account?`

On the site you can see avatar plug, they are clickable. through him you can get to your
profile or another user's profile.

( PS: In your profile you have `Delete Account` button and it doesn't work, sorry:) )
